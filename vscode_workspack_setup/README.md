# VSCode Settings

This is a per-workspace setup. `c_cpp_properties.json` configures the `C/C++ IntelliSense`. It will
need `compile_commands.json` (compile database), which can be dumped using either CMake or external
tools such as `bear`.

General settings are in `settings.json`. Unfortunately, I'm a light theme user, which means I don't
have too many good choices compared to the dark theme users. The color theme
`Harmonic16 light Theme` needs to be installed from the extensions. `Bluloco Light Theme` is also
a good one, but I'm getting tired of using it.

Also need to install `vim` extension.
